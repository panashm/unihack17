			   Inspired by Vitalik’s written article ““A Note On Charity
Through Marginal Price Discrimination”, CharitySync originated in 2017 when 4 handsome boys got together and created a system to increase volunteer participation. CharitySync incetivises users for their commendable acts in the community with virtual badges that can be used for redeemable rewards/discounts or as an achievement showcase. This site allows users to keep track of all their progress, search for events, view business and organisationas and see all information on one site.
